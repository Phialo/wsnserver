WSNServer
========

This collection of python scripts is useful for translating commands in a heterogenous 
network of various Wireless Sensor Nodes. You can define your general language and 
with dictionaries it sends localized commands to the node.
And well, it is also a general RESTful web applicance for accessing nodes in general.

Installation
------------

First you need to install [GIT](http://git-scm.com/) on your local host which is connected to the controlling node.
If you use Debian: `apt-get install git`

Afterwards you get the rolling-release version with:
`git clone git@github.com:Phialo/wsnserver.git`

For using the web server 'cherrypy' must be installed.
Download [Cherrypy](http://www.cherrypy.org/wiki/CherryPyDownload) and
install it by extracting the package and running `python setup.py`
   
You can use the sqlite database(not recommended due to lacking support of simultanous access) or 
install MySQL.   

Installing MySQL on Debian based systems:
`apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client libmysqlclient15-dev`

**NOTE:** it is important to install the libmysqlclient15-dev, else you could
      receive errors in the next step.

   
For running the setup, you will also need the MySQLdb driver.
**NOTE:** MySQL needs to be installed before running the installation for the following packages.

1. Install *python-setuptools* for your distribution. For Debian based systems `apt-get install python-setuptools`
2. [Download](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/) the driver
3. Install it by extracting the package and running `python setup.py install` from the wsnserver directory


Usage
------


For running the translator you need a local Wireless Sensor Node. The development was done on a 
Renesas ZMD28-BRD.

Run:
`python SerialReader.py -h` for explanation of command line variables and use the source for further adjustment.
