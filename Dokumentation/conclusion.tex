The middleware presented in this paper is a first step of providing a modular, basic system for the development and control of wireless sensor networks, adjustable to the needs of the environment.

The created wireless sensor network server fulfils the needs of a middleware, which supports the implementation of different node protocols and various kind of sensor nodes. 

The separation of the middleware into the \textit{Model-View-Controller} layers makes the system very modular and the implementation of new communication protocols easier and faster. Developers can use the already implemented solution for the \textit{Renesas} node as aid and template for new modules and it is their option to specify the location of the connected device, like USB or the serial port. 

Furthermore the middleware contains a fully functional web server with a RESTful API for communicating with the server. Developers can customize the web server and the interface to their needs.
