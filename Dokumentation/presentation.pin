Agenda:
1) About WSN
2) Existing Solutions
3) Python as Solution
4) Web-Based Interface
5) Le Fin
--
What are Wireless Sensor Nodes?

Problems?

Existing solution: www.wiselib.org

-- 

Their approach:
make use of advanced C++-Features as Templates
to provide access to various sensors for 
different WSN-OSes

-- 

Possible Problems:

1) Rapid changing environment
2) Changing Compiler Infrastructure(GCC->LLVM)
3) Heavy support needed for new gear

Let's use some high language instead!

--

It even runs on future's chips similar to
JINI for Java!

--

Back to real world problems...

--

How to save the sensor's data? Where? 
How retrieve? 
How to retain compatibility?

--

Retrieving data with external devices as 
Mobile phones?

--


iPhone? 
Android? 
Whatever with Internet Connectivity?
-- 

By the power of 

--
SQL

--

Using RESTful access via http and
JSON as data format

--

Don't forget: table allows dynamic content!

--

Also: cherrypy is not using a Webserver as 
Apache and acts as module!

--

But: it is a webserver on its own.

Plainly awesome.
